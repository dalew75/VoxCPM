hello everybody
and thank you for sharing your time with
me
i'm sending this message to various
different channels to reach my dear
russian friends
and the russian soldiers serving in
ukraine
i'm speaking to you today because there
are things that are going on in the
world that have been kept from you
terrible things that you should know
about
but before i talk about the harsh
realities let me just tell you about the
russian who became my hero
in 1961 when i was 14 years old a very
good friend of mine invited me to come
to vienna and to watch the world
weightlifting championships
