my grandfather was an American from
Minnesota um and my mom um mom was
born in Canada so I I do have some like
uh American uh background in fact um a
lot of people think like my name must be
from some exotic location but I was
named after my great-grandfather who was
uh from Minneapolis or St Paul.
I should say um and uh he was like a
school superintendent and part-time
sheriff in 1900 and uh 	And I was named
after him.
