Nearly a year before Donald Trump was
elected in 2024, an online prediction
market called Poly Market offered its
users a chance to bet against each other
on who would win the presidency. $3.6
billion was wagered on that one
question. In the final month of the
campaign, most pollsters were saying the
race was too close to call, but that was
conventional wisdom. Poly Market relied
on the wisdom of crowds and correctly
predicted the outcome. It's not just
elections Poly Market helps its
customers bet on. It's all kinds of
questions. Who will win the Super Bowl?
Will Taylor Swift get married this year?
When will there be a ceasefire in
Ukraine? The company was founded by a
precocious college dropout named Shane
Copelan who started building Poly Market
5 years ago when he was just 21.
Prediction markets aren't new, but not
many have earned the backing of
billionaire investors like Poly Market
has. If it all sounds a bit confounding,
it did to us, too. So, we started by
asking Shane Copelan the most basic
question of all.
